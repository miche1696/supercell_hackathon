Hi and Thank you for downloading the game!

Running is simple:
1. download the repo
2. copy the .env.example file into a .env file and add your OPENAI_KEY to it
3. move to the "scale_a_ton/" folder
4. run "python3 supercell_hackathon/test_mich/server.py"

IMPORTANT : To play the real, fully LLM-governed game, change the variable DEMO=0 in the .env file

Happy weighting!
